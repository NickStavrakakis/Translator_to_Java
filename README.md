# Translator to Java

## _Academic Year of 2019-2020_

This project is about the implementation of a parser and translator for a language supporting string operations. The language supports concatenation (+) and "reverse" operators over strings, function definitions and calls, conditionals and the prefix expression. The parser, based on a context-free grammar, translates the input language into Java, with the use of JavaCUP for the generation of the parser combined with the JFlex lexer.
